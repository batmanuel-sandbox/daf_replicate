daf_replicate -- a package for tranfering data across sites.

Currently, this package only supports manage_visits.sh for transfering
ImSim data to NCSA using the 3rd party transfer tool, FDT
(http://monalisa.cern.ch/FDT/). 

GETTING THIS PACKAGE:

A few binary distributions are available from
http://dev.lsstcorp.org/trac/wiki/ImSimDataTransfer: 

  o  daf_replicate-linux-i686.tar.gz -- for 32-bit Linux
  o  daf_replicate-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -- for 64-bit Linux
  o  daf_replicate-noarch.tar.gz -- generic (must obtain JRE separately)

All of these include the FDT tool (as a jar file).  The first two
include a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  

One can get the lastest source code from
svn://dev.lsstcorp.org/DMS/daf/replicate/trunk.  A source distribution
from SVN does include FDT nor the JVM.  

REQUIREMENTS

 o  FDT -- Fast Data Transfer tool (http://monalisa.cern.ch/FDT/)

    If your distribution did not include a lib subdirectory, then you
    need to download the FDT jar file from the FDT website

  o Java Runtime Engine (JRE; http://www.java.com)

    If your distribution did not include a jre subdirectory, then you
    need to download the JRE 1.6 package from the Java website.  

INSTALLATION

Installation and setup (for the manage_visits.sh tool) is done as
follows: 

  1.  Unpack the distribution where you want it installed and change
      into its root directory.  

  2.  Edit the configuration file, manage_visits.cfg, in the conf
      subdirectory.  Usually, only editing the parameter values in the
      first section should be necessary.  Save your changes.

  3.  Create your transfer directories as needed by running the
      bin/setup_manage_visits.sh: 

        % bash bin/setup_manage_visits.sh -f conf/manage_visits.cfg

   4. Check your setup by running the test script
      bin/test_manage_visits.sh: 

        % bash bin/setup_manage_visits.sh -f conf/manage_visits.cfg

You should be ready to run the tool.

RUNNING

To transfer some available ImSim data from you local machine to NCSA,
run the bin/manage_visits.sh:

  % bash bin/manage_visits.sh  -f conf/manage_visits.cfg

This script will only transfer a limited number of available visits
before it exits (2 by default); this limit can be changed in the
configuration file by editing the MAX_VCNT parameter.  

It is intended that this script can be executed on regular intervals
from a cron job.  A application file lock prevents multiple
simultaneous executions.
